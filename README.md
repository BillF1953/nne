# Variance Estimation in Neural Networks
Experimental code for an unpublished academic paper, [nne.pdf](nne.pdf), about estimating variance in neural network ensembles. The project builds neural network ensembles using simulated data from known functions. Since the functions were known, the variances are also known. We performed a coverage study to demonstrate the method was accurate. The file structure is as follows: 

#### /experiments

Experimental code in Jupyter notebooks and some earlier python files

#### /images 

Images for the paper

#### /datasets

Datasets for possible extension to real-world applications

#### /results

Experimental results
